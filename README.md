# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
In this project, we developed a predictive model to determine whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.
## **Dependencies**
To run the project, install the required Python libraries:

```
import pandas
import numpy
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```
## Data
To achieve this, we used tabular data from Kaggle, consisting of two files: train_data.csv and test_data.csv.
The dataset included detailed information about passengers and their tickets, such as age, gender, class, fare, and other relevant attributes.
